## for active developers

Run this command to enable merging instead of rebasing. (You need to run this only once per project)

```bash
git config pull.rebase false
```

Then, you can just pull and resolve the merge conflicts.

```bash
git pull
```

DonÂ´t forget to check for new dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
